He wants to move on, to have love and children, to trust. But the world doesn't want him. At least, not until they think he can help them steal the treasure they need to defeat the Elishians. A treasure that was supposedly lost in a place no one believes is real. But this treasure holds more secrets and trouble than he bargained for. The Devil's Pass is an adventure of finding one's people and gaining confidence.</div><div id="irt8sj-2-2-2">Rocks and Blades</div><div id="i0h1tc-2-2">Upcoming</div><div id="i9mmse-2-2">Time Ships</div><div id="inidwf-2-2">Upcoming</div></div><div id="idkigf"></div></body>
